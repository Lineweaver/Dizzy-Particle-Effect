# Dizzy-Particle-Effect
I couldn't find a classic, spinning stars cartoony dizzy effect asset, so I made one myself! The project includes two verison of the particle system, one with a 2D star sprite, and one with a 3D star mesh. There is also a very simple script attached to the particle system, making the particles spin. All used assets are included in the project.
